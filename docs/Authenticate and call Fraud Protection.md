## Authenticate and call Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection

You must send an authentication token with Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection API calls. See the following example for one way to do that. It then walks you through the process of creating a request and handling the response.

## Authenticate with Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection API
This example requires the following data to obtain an access token:

1. **Authority**: Your OAuth authority URL to authenticate against.
1. **Client ID**: Your Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection merchant application's ID in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
1. **Certificate**: The private certificate you've selected, with its public portion placed in your Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection merchant app in Azure AD.

```csharp
public class TokenProviderService : ITokenProvider
{
    private TokenProviderServiceSettings _settings;

    public TokenProviderService(IOptions<TokenProviderServiceSettings> settings)
    {
        _settings = settings.Value;
    }

    public async Task<string> AcquireTokenAsync(string resource)
    {
        var assertionCert = CertificateUtility.GetByThumbprint(_settings.CertificateThumbprint);
        var clientAssertion = new ClientAssertionCertificate(_settings.ClientId, assertionCert);
        
        var context = new AuthenticationContext(_settings.Authority);
        var authenticationResult = await context.AcquireTokenAsync(resource, clientAssertion);

        return authenticationResult.AccessToken;
    }
}
```
## Send events to Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection
All events sent to Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection follow the same JSON model:
```json
{
    merchantLocalDate = <event date in ISO 8601 format>,
    Data = <event data>
}
```

> The update account event is the only exception, also requiring a ```customerLocalDate``` top-level property.

However, the event data model varies from one event type to the next.

For example, see the following request and response when sending a refund event to Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection.
